Description: KeyGenes is an algorithm to predict the identity and determines 
	identity scores of queried samples (test set) to a provided group of
	samples (training set). It uses transcriptional profiles of the queried
	data (test set) and matches them to sets of transcriptional profiles of
	organs or cell types (training set). KeyGenes uses a 10-fold cross
	validation on the basis of a LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and
	Selection Operator) regression available in the R package “glmnet”
	(Friedman et al., 2010).
